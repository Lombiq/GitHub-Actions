# Lombiq's Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions



## About

Looking for some useful Orchard Core extensions? Here's a bundle solution of all of Lombiq's open-source Orchard Core extensions (modules and themes). Clone and try them out!

This is an [Orchard Core CMS](https://www.orchardcore.net/) Visual Studio solution that contains most of [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com)'s open-source Orchard modules and themes. Please keep in mind that only those extensions are included which use the latest released version of Orchard (i.e. the very cutting-edge ones depending on a nightly build are not yet here). Since the extensions are included as git submodules when cloning this repo set git to initialize submodules.

This also serves as an example of an ASP.NET Core web app using Orchard from NuGet.
