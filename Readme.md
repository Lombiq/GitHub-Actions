# Lombiq GitHub Actions

## About

Reusable workflows and actions for GitHub Actions shared between Lombiq projects, for example:

- Build and test [Orchard Core](https://www.orchardcore.net/) apps
- Build and test .NET Framework and .NET Core applications in general
- Publish packages to NuGet
- Verify and validate pull requests
- Check spelling tpyo fixed
- Perform static code analysis and linting
- And more!

These can be invoked from any other repository's build.
