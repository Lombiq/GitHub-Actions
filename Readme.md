# Lombiq's Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions



## About

An [Orchard Core CMS](https://www.orchardcore.net/) Visual Studio solution that contains most of [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com)'s open-source Orchard modules and themes. Only those extensions are included which use the latest released version of Orchard (i.e. ones depending on a nightly build are not yet here). Since the extensions are included as git submodules when cloning this repo set git to initialize submodules

This also serves as an example of an ASP.NET Core web app using Orchard from NuGet.
