# Publish NuGet package

Builds the project with the .NET SDK and publishes it as a NuGet package to the configured NuGet feed. Example _publish.yml_:

```yaml
name: Publish to NuGet

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v*

jobs:
  publish-nuget:
    name: Publish to NuGet
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/publish-nuget.yml@dev
    secrets:
      apikey: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_NUGET_PUBLISH_API_KEY }}
```

The _publish.yml_ workflow is triggered on a tag pushed to any branch with the prefix `v` and should contain a [valid version number](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/package-versioning#version-basics), e.g. `v1.0.1`, which will be extracted and used to version the NuGet packages produced.

There is no configuration required for automated Orchard Core extension manifest versioning, all of the `Manifest.cs` files are looked up, and the existing `Version` properties are updated automatically inside the `Module` or `Theme` definition with the version pushed. Note that the `Version` property should be present and leave the version number on the default value (0.0.1). This is because we don't actually need to keep manifest version changes in the code.

It takes one non-optional secret parameter, `apikey`, the organization API key for pushing to NuGet, and two optional parameters, `source` and `verbosity`. E.g.:

```yaml
jobs:
  publish-nuget:
    name: Publish to NuGet
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/publish-nuget.yml@dev
    with:
      source: https://nuget.cloudsmith.io/lombiq/open-source-orchard-core-extensions/v3/index.json
      verbosity: detailed
    secrets:
      apikey: ${{ secrets.CLOUDSMITH_NUGET_PUBLISH_API_KEY }}
```

When `source` is not provided, it assumes a default value of pushing to the [Lombiq NuGet feed](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Lombiq).

Valid values for `verbosity` are those defined by [MSBuild](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference?view=vs-2022#:~:text=you%20can%20specify%20the%20following%20verbosity%20levels). The default value is `minimal`.

 Things to keep in mind:

- If you have multiple projects in the repository or if the project you want to build is in a subfolder, then add a solution to the root of the repository that references all projects you want to build.
- References to projects (`<ProjectReference>` elements) not in the repository won't work, these need to be changed to package references (`<PackageReference>` elements). Make the conditional based on `$(NuGetBuild)`. See the [Helpful Extensions project file](https://github.com/Lombiq/Helpful-Extensions/blob/dev/Lombiq.HelpfulExtensions/Lombiq.HelpfulExtensions.csproj) for an example. References to projects in the repository will work and those projects, if configured with the proper metadata, will be published together, with dependencies retained among the packages too.
