          Change this to any other value to alter the cache key, effectively invalidating the latest cache. This is the

          (https://github.community/t/how-to-clear-cache-in-github-actions/129038/5) until the associated issue
          (https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/2) is resolved and the feature is available not just via the RESTful
          API.
