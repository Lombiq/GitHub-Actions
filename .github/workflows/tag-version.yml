          An authentication token, like a personal access token (PAT), that provides 'Workflow' permission with write
          access to the workflow files of the repository and can be used to modify GitHub actions and workflows. This is
          necessary because when a pull request is merged while being authenticated with the default GITHUB_TOKEN of a
          workflow run, then the merge won't trigger other workflows (like a build workflow on the target branch). This
          is an intentional limitation, see:
          https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow.
          Thus, we need to use an alternative authentication token. See
          https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
          for info on how to create PATs; you'll need one with the "work" scope. We recommend creating such a token from
          under a bot user account only used for such operations, so it's not tied to a natural person.
