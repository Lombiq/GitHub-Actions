            Stringified JSON array with the name of the type of machine(s) to run the workflow under, e.g.

          If set to "true", the NuGet packages will be cached by GitHub. This is faster if you have a lot of NuGet

          Change this to any other value to alter the cache key, effectively invalidating the latest cache. This is the 
          only current way to force "clear" the cache (https://github.community/t/how-to-clear-cache-in-github-actions/129038/5)
          until the associated issue (https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/2) is resolved.

  # other workflows, they'd need to be encapsulated in a composite action. That, however, will result in a single step
