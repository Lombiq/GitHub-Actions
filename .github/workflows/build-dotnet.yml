          Stringified JSON array with the name of the type of machine(s) to run the workflow under, e.g.
          "['ubuntu-22.04']" or "['ubuntu-22.04', 'windows-2022']".
      dotnet-version:

        description: Version of the .NET SDK to set up.

        default: 'false'
        description: >
          If set to "true", the NuGet packages will be cached by GitHub. This is faster if you have a lot of NuGet
          packages, but negligible or even slower if you only have a handful. When run on BuildJet, it will use the
          BuildJet cache instead of GitHub's, which is faster.
      build-enable-npm-caching:
        type: string
        default: 'false'
        description: >
          If set to "true", the NPM packages will be cached by GitHub. This is faster if you have a lot of NPM packages,
          but negligible or even slower if you only have a handful.

        type: string
        default: '0'
        description: >
          Change this to any other value to alter the cache key, effectively invalidating the latest cache. This is an
          alternative to clearing the cache manually, see
          https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#managing-caches.
      timeout-minutes:

      verify-dotnet-consolidation:
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: >
          When set to true, it will be verified whether the NuGet packages of the .NET solution are consolidated, i.e.
          the same version of a given package is used in all projects.

  # While the below steps seem suitable to DRY with build-and-test-orchard-core, since reusable workflows can't call
  # other workflows, they'd need to be encapsulated in a composite action. That, however, will result in a single step
  # being shown under the build details with all below steps mushed together.
