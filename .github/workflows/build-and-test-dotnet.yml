        description: >
          An optional technical identifier that is used to construct the concurrency key to be able to distinguish
          different jobs in the same parent workflow calling this one. This is necessary if you build multiple solutions
          (as separate jobs) in the same workflow for these jobs not to conflict with each other.
        type: string
        default: 'parent-job'
        required: false
      cancel-workflow-on-failure:
        description: When set to "true", it will cancel the current workflow run with all jobs if this workflow fails.
        type: string

      machine-types:
        type: string
        default: "['ubuntu-22.04']"
        description: >
          Stringified JSON array with the name of the type of machine(s) to run the workflow under, e.g.
          "['ubuntu-22.04']" or "['ubuntu-22.04', 'windows-2022']".
      dotnet-version:
        type: string

      build-configuration:
        type: string
        default: Release
        description: Configuration parameter for dotnet build (e.g. Debug, Release).
      build-solution-path:
        type: string
        default: '*.sln'
        description: >
          The path of the solution or project file to be built. If there's exactly one .sln file in the build directory

        type: string
        default: 'false'
        description: >
          If set to "true", the NuGet packages will be cached by GitHub. This is faster if you have a lot of NuGet
          packages, but negligible or even slower if you only have a handful. When run on BuildJet, it will use the
          BuildJet cache instead of GitHub's, which is faster.
      build-enable-npm-caching:
        type: string
        default: 'false'
        description: >
          If set to "true", the NPM packages will be cached by GitHub. This is faster if you have a lot of NPM packages,
          packages, but negligible or even slower if you only have a handful. When run on BuildJet, it will use the
          BuildJet cache instead of GitHub's, which is faster.

        type: string
        default: '0'
        description: >
          Change this to any other value to alter the cache key, effectively invalidating the latest cache. This is an
          alternative to clearing the cache manually, see
          https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#managing-caches.
      build-create-binary-log:
        type: string
        default: 'false'
        description: >
          Configures MSBuild to create a binary log. This is useful to inspect and debug builds. See
          https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md for details.
      build-binary-log-artifact-retention-days:
        type: string
        default: '14'
        description: >
          Duration in days after which the artifact of the build's binary log (if any) will expire. See

      dotnet-test-process-timeout:
        required: false
        type: number
        default: -1
        description: Run the dotnet test process with the given timeout in milliseconds. -1 means no timeout.

      xunit-max-parallel-threads:
        type: string
        default: '0'
        description: >
          Sets the maxParallelThreads configuration in all available xUnit xunit.runner.json configuration files. See
          https://xunit.net/docs/configuration-files#maxParallelThreads for details on available values.
      timeout-minutes:
        type: number
        default: 360
        description: Configuration for the timeout-minutes parameter of the workflow. The 360 is GitHub's default.
      verify-dotnet-consolidation:
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: >
          When set to true, it will be verified whether the NuGet packages of the .NET solution are consolidated, i.e.
          the same version of a given package is used in all projects.
      dotnet-consolidation-exclude-version-regex:
        type: string
        required: false
        default: '\-alpha'
        description: >
          A regular expression to match package versions that will be skipped during NuGet package consolidation.
      warnings-as-errors:
        type: string
        default: 'true'
        description: >
          Whether compiler warnings should be treated as errors during the build process. The default value is "true",
          the compiler flag "-warnaserror" will be used, causing the build to fail if any warnings are generated. If set
          to "false", the flag "-warnaserror" will not be used, allowing warnings to be generated without causing the
          build to fail.

      # the already running job (with the same strategy) for this pull request to be cancelled. Otherwise it will be the
      # ID of the workflow run combined with the strategy parameters, making it more unique so that parallel runs of
      # this job aren't kept waiting. This workflow's technical name is also included in both cases, so that it doesn't
      # conflict with other jobs calling a different workflow that are started by the same caller workflow. The caller
      # job's technical name is optionally included in the concurrency key, so that different jobs in the same parent
      # workflow calling this one don't conflict with each other.
