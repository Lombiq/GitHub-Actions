name: Build and Test .NET Solution with MSBuild

concurrency:
  # If "cancel-in-progress-for-this-pr" is set to "true" and this run is for a pull request, then the concurrency
  # key will be constructed from a handful of parameters to produce a value that would evaluate to the same value on
  # a subsequent push (while still allowing different solutions to be built with the same configuration), causing
  # the already running job (with the same strategy) for this pull request to be cancelled. Otherwise it will be the
  # ID of the workflow run combined with the strategy parameters, making it more unique so that parallel runs of
  # this job aren't kept waiting. This workflow's technical name is also included in both cases, so that it doesn't
  # conflict with other jobs calling a different workflow that are started by the same caller workflow. The caller
  # job's technical name is optionally included in the concurrency key, so that different jobs in the same parent
  # workflow calling this one don't conflict with each other.

          The path of the solution or project file to be built. If you have exactly one .sln file in the current
          directory then this can be omitted. Otherwise make sure to specify it to avoid an "MSB1008: Only one project
          can be specified." error that is thrown when the `*.sln` wildcard results in multiple files. To build a
          project file you must specify a path that ends with `.csproj`. An example: "./src/*Web/*.Web.csproj". The
          value is given to PowerShell's `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet as-is, so grepping is still possible but a name with
          spaces must be escaped separately.
