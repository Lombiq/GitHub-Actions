name: Build and Test Windows

# Windows builds are only run on-demand, to be run once before merging a PR, and for pushes to dev. This is because
# Windows builds are much slower and more expensive than Ubuntu ones, and them catching issues that aren't surfaced
# under Ubuntu is rare (but does happen). So, not running them for every push of every PR.
