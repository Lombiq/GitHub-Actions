name: Build and Test Windows

# Windows builds are only run on-demand, enforced to be run once before merging a PR, and for pushes to dev. This is
# because Windows builds are much slower and more expensive than Ubuntu ones, and them catching issues that aren't
# surfaced under Ubuntu is rare (but does happen). So, not running them for every push of every PR.
