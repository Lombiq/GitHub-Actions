concurrency:
  # If "cancel-in-progress-for-this-pr" is set to "true" and this is running for a pull request, then the concurrency
  # key will be constructed from the name of the workflow and the branch name, causing the already running job in this
  # workflow for this pull request to be cancelled. Otherwise it will be the ID of the workflow run, making it globally
  # unique and not cancel anything. Concurrency is defined for the whole workflow, because it has only two jobs
  # (check-spelling and comment-pr) and the latter depends on the former, so they won't run in parallel. A technical
  # name for this workflow is also included in both cases, so that it doesn't come into conflict with other jobs calling
  # a different workflow that are started by the same caller workflow.
