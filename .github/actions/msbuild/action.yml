name: MSBuild .NET Framework Build with Static Code Analysis
description: Builds the .NET Framework solution in the given directory with static code analysis.

inputs:
  directory:
    required: false
    default: .
    description: Path to the directory where a solution file can be found.
  verbosity:
    required: false
    default: quiet
    description: Verbosity parameter for msbuild.
  treat-warnings-as-errors:
    required: false
    default: "true"
    description: If set to "true", warnings produced during the build will be treated as errors and fail the build.
  enable-code-analysis:
    required: false
    default: "true"
    description: If set to "true", static code analysis is enabled during the build.
  publish-version:
    required: false
    default: "1.${{ github.run_number }}.${{ github.run_attempt }}-${{ github.run_id }}"
    description: The value given to `msbuild`'s `-Version` switch.
  msbuild-switches:
    required: false
    default: ""
    description: >
      Additional command line switches given to `msbuild`. You must split these into multiple lines, even the parameter
      value.
  solution-or-project-path:
    required: false
    default: "*.sln"
    description: >
      The path of the solution or project file to be built. If you have exactly one .sln file in the current directory
      then this can be omitted. Otherwise make sure to specify it to avoid an "MSB1008: Only one project can be
      specified." error that is thrown when the `*.sln` wildcard results in multiple files. To build a project file you
      must specify a path that ends with `.csproj`. An example: "./src/*Web/*.Web.csproj". The value is given to
      PowerShell's `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet as-is, so grepping is still possible but a name with spaces must be escaped
      separately.
