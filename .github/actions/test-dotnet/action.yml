name: Run .NET tests
description: >
  Runs .NET unit and UI tests (with the Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox for Orchard Core:
  https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox), generates a test report and uploads UI testing failure dumps to
  artifacts.

inputs:
  build-directory:
    required: false
    default: .
    description: Path to the directory where a solution file can be found and thus the .NET build has run.
  solution-path:
    required: false
    default: "*.sln"
    description: >
      The path of the solution or project file to be built. If you have exactly one .sln file in the current directory
      then this can be omitted. Otherwise make sure to specify it to avoid a "Found more than one solution file in
      <path>. Specify which one to use." error that is thrown when the `*.sln` wildcard results in multiple files.
  test-verbosity:
    required: false
    default: quiet
    description: Verbosity parameter for dotnet test.
  test-filter:
    required: false
    description: >
      Filter expression for dotnet test. See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/selective-unit-tests.
  test-configuration:
    required: false
    description: Value passed to the --configuration parameter of dotnet test.
    default: "Debug"
  ui-test-parallelism:
    required: false
    default: "-1"
    description: >
      Determines how many UI tests will run in parallel. Affects both xUnit's maxParallelThreads configuration and the
      MaxParallelTests configuration of Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox. If set to "-1" then the configuration coming from the
      code won't be overridden.

    # Note that uploading the failure dumps would fail under Windows if the path were too long, regardless of

    # FailureDumps into the solution root. The following two steps need to be success() || failure() (excluding the
    # workflow being cancelled), so if there's a failure dump it'll be uploaded even if the tests are ultimately passed
    # after retries.
