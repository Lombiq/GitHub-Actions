    # setup-dotnet won't install a version if it is already preinstalled on the VM. Note that it checks the latest
    # released .NET version for wildcard versions. So, e.g. with 6.0.x specified it'll still install 6.0.402 if the VM
    # only has 6.0.401. See: https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/356 about making this better.
